# Software for robot remote control
This project was the integral part of my bachelor thesis. It is a cross platform software developed for remote controlling of a mobile robot with an additional mechanical arm attached to it. The arm has three degrees of freedom. Most of the part was done with the usage of flutter, while the control was implemented with python. Currently there is no final build of the app, but it is testable. While basic functionalities are implemented, additional changes will be made for the better functioning of the app itself.
